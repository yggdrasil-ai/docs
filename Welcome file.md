# Welcome to Spokes - Your AI Agent Platform

Welcome to **SpokesAI**, the simplest way to create and manage your own Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents!

But what are these agents (or **spokes**, as we like to call them)? In essence, they are advanced AI models that can understand, process, and respond to human language, while being able to perform real actions. Simply put, they are chatbots that talk like actual humans, and can manage different tasks - ranging from the simple, like sending mails, to the complex, like scripting and producing full podcasts. Whether you need a virtual assistant, a customer support representative, or a personal tutor, a spoke can handle the job.

With SpokesAI, you don't need deep technical knowledge to bring these spokes to life. It's an ideal tool for small business owners seeking to automate customer support, educators aiming to transform teaching methods, or anyone simply fascinated by AI.

## What Can You Do with Spokes?

1.  **Create Spokes**: Design your own AI agent capable of interacting with users in natural language, understanding their needs, and providing relevant responses.
2.  **Customize Your Spokes**: Tailor your AI's conversational style, behavior, and approved actions to your specific requirements. Import your own documents to establish a solid knowledge base for your spokes.
3. **Empower Your Spokes to Act**: Equip your AI with the capability to perform a diverse range of actions using our growing set of built-in features, anything that Zapier can automate, or any custom action you program.
4. **Interact & Learn**: Engage with your AI, observe their skills in action, and fine-tune their capabilities based on performance.
5. **Seamless Integration**: Effortlessly integrate your spokes into a wide range of tools for a smooth user experience.
