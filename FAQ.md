# FAQ

**Q1: I've created a Spoke, but it's not quite doing what I expected. What can I do?**

Configuring a Spoke to work just the way you want can take some fine-tuning. Make sure that your Spoke's actions, knowledge base, personality, and goal are all aligned with your needs. If it's still not behaving as expected, try to use our assistant's help by clicking it when you are configuring your spoke. If this way you still don't succeed, you can tell it to reach out to our support team.

**Q2: Can I update a bibliotheca I've already created?**

Yes, you can update your bibliothecas. Please note that updating a bibliotheca effectively overwrites it, replacing the previous version with the new one.

**Q3: What happens when I hit my conversation limit?**

If you hit your conversation limit, your Spokes will not be able to carry out more conversations until you upgrade your plan or the next billing period starts. You can check your current usage in the Config page.

**Q4: I need to implement a custom integration. How can I do that?**

Custom integrations can be built using the SpokesAI API. You can refer to our [technical documentation](#) for detailed steps on how to do this.

**Q7: What is the difference between the various language models (LLM) available?**

Different language models have different capabilities and complexities. For instance, `gpt-3.5-turbo` and `llama-2` are suitable for basic tasks, while `gpt-4` is more powerful and can handle more complex tasks. The choice of a language model depends on your specific needs and budget.

**Q8: How can I train my Spoke to improve its performance?**

Improving the performance of your Spoke involves refining its configuration parameters. This includes its knowledge base, personality, actions, and overall goal. The more specific and detailed you can be in these settings, the better your Spoke will perform. Remember to use the assistant when configuring your spoke, it's there to help.

**Q9: How long does it take for changes to my Spoke's configuration to take effect?**

Changes to your Spoke's configuration generally take effect immediately. If you don't notice the changes, please reach out to our support team for assistance.

**Q10: Are there any content restrictions for the bibliotheca documents?**

Documents added to the bibliotheca should be relevant to your Spoke's knowledge base and must not contain sexual, violent, or damaging/dangerous content. The rights and responsibility for the content remain with the user. Please refer to our user terms and conditions for more information.
